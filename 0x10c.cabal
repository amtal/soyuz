synopsis: DCPU-16 implementation for Notch's 0x10c game.
description:
        Implementation of the DCPU-16 architecture for Notch's upcoming space game, 0x10c.
        .
        Meant to be a library for implementing powerful tools. As demonstrations, contains
        a command-line optimizing assembler, disassembler, and debugging interpreter.
        .
        Core of the library is "DCPU16.Instructions". Everything else is built around it.
